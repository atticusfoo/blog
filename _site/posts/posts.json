For the purposes of this data-makeover, we will focus on the opinions and attitudes of respondents towards COVID-19 and the vaccination around the world. Data is taken from the Imperial College London YouGov Covid 19 Behaviour Tracker Data Hub here.\r\nThis post will attempt to re-present (makeover) the chart found in the next section, applying techniques learned in Professor Kam’s class on visualising uncertainty, as well as Steve Wexler’s extensive thoughts on presenting ‘neutral’ values. The following sections can be found below:\r\n#1 Assessment of visualisation based on clarity and aesthetics\r\n#2 Sketch of alternate design\r\n#3 Proposed visualisation in Tableau\r\n#4 Step-by-step guide\r\n#5 Insights from the visualisation\r\n#1 Asessment of visualisation based on clarity and aesthetics\r\nSource: BeforeWithout the context of the primary communication intent of the above chart, it is difficult to provide an assessment of how it can be improved. As such,the critique below will be based solely on the rubrics of clarity and aesthetics.\r\n1.1 Clarity\r\n1.1.1 Titles and legends have not been edited\r\n• The current titles are not the most intuitive – as the corresponding charts do not convey the intended message. For instance, the first chart is labelled ‘which country is more pro-vaccine’, but the corresponding chart is a representation of how respondents in respective countries voted on a scale of 1 to 5. As such, it is not very clear how the first chart conveys the intended message, as the chart on the right would suffice. There is also a small typographical error in the title of the first chart.\r\n• The subtitles of both charts % of Total Record and % Strongly Agreed, should be edited.\r\n1.1.2 Visualising uncertainty\r\n• As data in the charts are represented as percentages, it is not possible to get a sense of the proportion of respondents from each country. As such, readers would assume that the values presented in the charts are equal and consistently reproducible to the same degree. Survey data can be impacted by various factors such as the number of respondents involved (thus affecting Confidence Intervals).\r\n1.1.3 Juxtaposition of different types of bar charts\r\n• The use of a 100% stacked bar chart on the left helps readers to easily compare values easily as they have a common baseline in 0% and 100%. However, in terms of clarity, the use of different bar charts (stacked bar chart on the left and horizontal bar chart on the right) may detract as the same value will appear visually different. This is not helped by the different treatment of the X-axis in both charts, with the first chart using 0 to 100% and the second chart ending at 60%. As a result, the value of ‘strongly agree’ on the left would look different from the one on the right even though they are of the same value.\r\n1.1.4 Axis values not sorted\r\n• The Y-axis of the chart on the left is sorted alphabetically while the chart on the right is sorted in descending order. As the categories in the y-axis of both charts are the same (countries), they should be sorted for visual clarity and allow readers to more easily reference both charts at once. This can be sorted by volume of those who are more agreeable to vaccination – to reflect the crux of message found in the chart title.\r\n• Additionally, as both charts will have the same Y-axis, the country labels on the second chart can be removed to reduce visual clutter.\r\n1.2 Aesthetics\r\n1.2.1 Use of colours\r\n• The choice of colours is good as it is contrasty and is generally able to help readers discern the differences between the discrete categories found in the chart. Further improvements could be made if the choice of colours were more deliberate. For instance, the current selection of red to represent value 3 (neutral) could be replaced with grey, a colour that is more universally accepted as neutral.\r\n• This is similar for the selection of green which is generally associated with ‘agree’ or ‘positive’ rather than its current representation which is ‘strongly disagree’. This is repeated in the choice of orange, which is placed beside red/neutral, but actually reflects ‘agree’.\r\n• As the categories selected are on a Likert scale, dual colours with variances could have been employed in order to highlight the differences in choices along the scale.\r\n1.2.2 Legends\r\n• In terms of placement, the colour legend on the right could be placed nearer to the chart on the left for easier visual reference. It also assumes that readers have prior knowledge as to what the categorical values 2, 3 and 4 mean as they are currently unlabelled. It is also unclear what ‘Vac 1’ means.\r\n• In terms of order, the order of the colours for legend could be reversed so that it matches the chart on the left where the colours go from green to blue, instead of the current order which is blue to green.\r\n1.2.3 Gridlines\r\n• The use of gridlines in the second chart help to negate the use of value labels which would add to clutter and distract from the overall presentation of the chat. This can be improved by using narrow bands for the tick-marks as the current 20% increment is quite wide, making it difficult to visualise accurately. This is not helped by the fact that most of the values fall between 20% to 45%.\r\n#2 Sketch of alternate design\r\nSource: Sketch of alternativeThe sketch above shows a diverging bar chart with the neutrals placed to the side. This is because we want to give stronger emphasis to the stronger views by placing them in the center of the chart.\r\n When the neutrals were placed in the center of the chart, it makes it difficult for the reader to compare the strongest values taken from the survey.\r\nSource: Neutrals SideInitially, we wanted to place the neutrals on the outside but this would mean artificially splitting the neutrals. This was not ideal as the neutral value was neither positive nor negative. As such, we would attempt to place the data to the side.\r\nIn terms of colours, we re-arranged the values according to colour temperature as well as contrast. We will also sort the countries (Y-Axis) so that both axis are consistent for easier visual referencing. In terms of visualising uncertainty, we want to add a confidence interval, to suggest the range of values that the respondents of the respective country were most likely to select. This would be marked at the 95% interval.\r\nSource: TooltipAs there is a lot useful demographic data collected by You Gov, we wanted to see if we could apply this to the dashboard in the form of an interactive tool-tip – and to see if any discernible findings could be made.\r\n#3 PROPOSED VISUALISATION IN TABLEAU\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Data Re-presented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis visualisation was built using Tableau Desktop Professional Edition 2020.40 and can be found here\r\nThe key changes made in the data visualisation is explained and outlined in the paper sketch above. The Likert Scale used in the YouGov survey has been reproduced in a diverging stacked bar chart with the neutral values at the side.\r\nInstead of a bar chart on the right, we have adopted the line and dot chart in order to present the range of values that more likely to occur for the response ‘Strongly Agree’. More granularity is also added – so as to present differences between male and female responses (if any).\r\nSource: Waffle ChartFor the tool tip, we experimented with the waffle chart (since it was more space efficient) to visualise demographic data (age groups and employment status). However, this implementation was not ideal and can be improved in further iterations. Finally A series of five questions can be selected with the data applying to both charts at once.\r\n#4 Step-by-step guide\r\nThe following steps will provide a brief overview of how the visualisation was completed.\r\nData Preparation\r\nThe data used for the visualisations were taken from the Imperial College London YouGov Covid 19 Behaviour Tracker Data Hub here.\r\nSource: Data UnionAs the data is separated in different countries, the different csv files have to be extracted. Using Tableau’s union function, we be able to join the files together.\r\nWe will need to hide unnecessary fields – such as demographic data or other health related questions. This is because we want to focus specifically on questions related to vaccination. We can do this by clicking “Manage Metadata” and then hiding the selected fields.\r\nThe fields we want to retain are country, age, gender, household size, number of children in household, employment status and questions related to the vaccine (vac2_1, vac2_2, vac2_3, vac2_6 and vac3).\r\nSource: Data PivotAfter checking the field names using Tableau’s Data Prep to ensure that they are accurately categorised (e.g. numeric and string), we want to select all the question fields and pivot the values as seen in the photo above.\r\nNext we want create additional fields for QuestionID as well as Answers and Scores The latter two categories are to create string and integer values for the responses. The screenshots including the codes can be found in the photos below.\r\n\r\nPlotting the Diverging Bar Chart with Neutrals Aside\r\nWith the data prepared, we can begin plotting the first chart – which is the diverging bar chart. To do this, we will need to prepare the data by sorting the responses (strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree) into proportions (percentages). To do this, we will first create a ‘dummy’ field called Number of Records Ref before we can start preparing the calculated fields.\r\nSource: CF PositiveAs seen in the photo above, the field [Positive %] is defined as: SUM(IF [Score]>=4 then 1, else 0 END)/ SUM([Number of Records Ref]). This calculates the sum of both agree and strongly agree responses divided by the total number of responses. Repeat this to get the percentage for negative as well as neutral (neutral = 3) responses as seen in the screenshot below.\r\nSource: CF NegativeIn order to show the 4 levels of sentiment, we will need to need to create another calculated field [POSNEG]. The exclude statement ensures that Tableau doesn’t double count each of the 5 levels of sentiment.\r\nSource: CF POSNEGTo plot this chart, we will need to place the calculated field [POSNEG] and [Neutral %] into the columns section and [Question] and [Country] into rows as seen in the screenshot below. This will create a dual axis chart that will keep the neutral values separate.\r\nSource: Dual AxisWe will need to filter by [Answers] so as to remove all the null values – these are incomplete responses and hence should be removed from the findings as they would affect the percentages. At the same time, we will add [QUESTION] to the filter and select ‘show’. This will allow you to select the difference questions on the right – and the chart will respond dynamically to the selections. You can edit the appearance of the filter by choosing a drop down menu or a multi-select option.\r\nSource: Exclude FilterIn order to sort the countries by descending order to give a better visual representation, right click [Country] and select sort ‘Field’. Choose descending order, the appropriate field name (in your case [Positive %] and aggregation by ‘Average’.\r\nSource: SortSource: ColoursLastly to complete this chart, we would want to improve the colour scheme by clicking on the ‘Colour’ icon. This will allow you to adjust the colours of the values. We have gone with the colour scheme seen in the screenshot below to give a more association towards similar values and darker colours to represent stronger opinions (agree or disagree).\r\nCreating the Error Bar on Dot Plot\r\nSource: Error PlotNext to create the error bar on dot plot for ‘Strongly Agree’ responses, we would have to create a few calculated fields in order to identify the lower and upper limit for confidence intervals at 95 and 99%. We can first do this by creating calculated fields for Z-scores of 95 and 99 as seen in the screen shot below.\r\nSource: ZScoresTo calculate the proportion of ‘Strongly agree’ responses, we will create a calculate field [C – Strongly Agree] using the formula “IF [Score]=5 THEN 1, ELSE 0”.\r\nUsing this we can identify the percentage proportion by using the next calculated field formulate “SUM([C - Strong Agree ])/SUM({Exclude [Answer]: SUM([Number of Records Ref])})”. Next we can create the [C – Prop_SE], [C-Prop Margin 99] and [C – Prop Margin 95] using the calculated fields seen in the screenshot below to identify lower and upper limit.\r\nSource: Prop SEThe final 2 calculated fields we want to create for this step is the lower and upper bounds of the 95 confidence interval – so that we can create a line across the bubble plot to demonstrate the interval. We can do this by simply using the codes “[C - Prop] - [C - Prop Margin 95]” and “[C - Prop] + [C - Prop Margin 95].\r\nSource: Plot1To plot the error bar, we will need to create a dual axis chart. We do this by moving the [C-Prop], [C-upper] and [C-lower] fields create earlier into the columns section and [Question] into rows.\r\nSimilar to the steps for the diverging bar chart, we will want to filter by [Question] and [Answer]. The dual axis chart will look similar to the screenshot above.\r\nSource: LineIn order to change the lower and upper limits into a line bar, we can click on “Measure Values” and select the line chart option. We will also need to click on “Path” and select the third option for “Line Type” in order to obtain the line bar as seen in the photo above.\r\nSource: Dual AxisNext, right click on the axis on the second chart and select ‘Dual Axis’ in order to combine both charts. Effectively, these collapses both charts and overlays both the dot plot and line bar on top of each other.\r\nSource: Synchronizing the axisRight click on the same x-axis again and select synchronise axis in order to ensure that the charts are not distorted due to a difference in dimensions on the axis. The error bar on dot plot will not be complete.\r\nCreating the Waffle Chart\r\nSource: Waffle ChartThe additional waffle chart created for this visualisation is intended to provided additional demographic data in the tool tip – and serve as an alternative to to the typical bar chart which takes up more space as seen below.\r\nSource: Bar ChartIn order to crate the waffle chart, we will first need to create a 10x10 template in an excel file. It should look like the screenshot below. Add this new data source. Once it is added, convert “Column” and “Row” to “Dimension” by right clicking on each.\r\nSource: waffle TemplateNext we will have to build the skeleton of the waffle chart by dragging the dimensions “Column” to column and “Rows” to rows. Select the “Square” chart in mark type and adjust the size by using the slider and dragging the bottom and right axis to resize.\r\nSource: Waffle SkelettonNext we need to prepare calculated fields for all the age groups. To do this we need to bin the different age groups by using the formula in the screenshot below. Repeat this for the other age groups (depending on the range you prefer).\r\nSource: Age GroupsWe can now create a calculated field to calculate how much each proportion of the age group [A – AGER] is using the formula in the screen shot below.\r\nSource: FormulaTo plot the chart, drag [A – AGER] to “Colour”, “Country”, “Employment Status” and “Question” to Column and “Answer” to Row. Similar to previous steps, use the filter option on “Answer” and “Question” in order to remove null values and reflect the desired data relating to the target question. Edit the colours of the Waffle Chart using the option found in Marks. We have opted to use a greyscale to reflect the different age groups.\r\nCreating the Dashboard\r\nSource: DashboardFinally, to plot the dashboard, select “New Dashboard” and set resolution to Custom Size (1000 x 1000). We will be adding three worksheets (Diverging Bar Chart, Error Bar and Waffle) to the dashboard.\r\nSource: WorksheetsAn important step to make is to ensure that all the worksheets are linked so that all charts reflect the data relating to the question selected. This is important because the results used in the second chart is derived from the first. To do this, right click on the filter and apply the data sets to the selected worksheets as seen in the screenshot below.\r\nSource: TooltipWe will also need to add a tooltip in order for the waffled chart to be displayed when the reader hovers over the Diverging Bar Chart. To do this, navigate back to the first worksheet and click on the Tooltip selection in Marks. Insert the worksheet which the Waffle Chart is named in order to create the tooltip. \r\nLastly, layout the charts onto the dashboard as seen the screenshot above. We have chosen put both charts on top of each other instead of side-by-side due to the wider aspect of dual-axis charts. From here, cosmetic changes can be made to the titles and axis titles / legends by double-clicking on them.\r\n#5 Analysis\r\n5.1 Asian Countries, South Korea, Singapore and Japan less pro-COVID-19 vaccine?\r\nSource: Pro Vaccine?Asian countries like South Korea, Singapore and Japan appeared to be less pro vaccine, with 34, 29 and 25% of their respondents stating that they would strongly agree to taking the vaccine within a year from now, if it becomes available to them.\r\nWhile they felt less strongly towards the vaccine, they were also less likely to disagree with the vaccine (Singapore’s 8% strongly disagreeing compared to Germany’s 23%). At the same time, there is a greater proportion of neutral respondents from these countries, suggesting that they could be persuaded if circumstances change or if there was a greater public communications drive to do so. Comparatively, countries with high number of cases and death rates have greater responses.\r\n5.2 Worried about the potential side-effects of the vaccine.\r\nSource: Potential Side EffectsRespondents France, Spain, Japan and Singapore were the top countries in terms of those who were most worried about the potential side effects of the vaccine.\r\nSource: GovThis is interesting as more than 60% of Singaporeans agreed that the Government would provide them with an effective COVID-19 vaccine (with less than 10% disagreeing otherwise).\r\nSource: Potential Side EffectsAdditionally, female respondents tended to respond strongly to agree that they were worried about than male respondents the potential side effects of the vaccine. This is tracked at the 95% CI limits as seen in the chart above.\r\n5.3 Older Singaporeand who are unemployed may be at risk\r\nSource: WaffleBased on the waffle chart, the proportion of older Singaporeans in Singapore who were unemployed were more likely to strongly disagree that the Government would provide them with an effective COVID-19 vaccine.\r\nSource: Waffle2They were also more likely to strongly agree about the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine and they strongly disagreed with getting vaccinated if it were available to them within a year.\r\nSource: Waffle3Conversely the proportion of respondents who were younger Singaporeans who were also unemployed were more worried about getting COVID-19.\r\n#References:\r\nRethinking the divergent stacked bar chart – placing the stronger views in the centre Tableau Playbook – Waffle Chart\r\nThank you for reading up to this point!\r\nThis blog is a data visualisation assignment for the MITB programme at the Singapore Management University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

As part of the assignment, we will attempt to ‘makeover’ a chart depicting the resident labour force by age. The following sections of this makeover attempt can be found below:\r\n#1 Assessment of visualisation based on clarity and aesthetics\r\n#2 Sketch of alternate design\r\n#3 Proposed visualisation in Tableau\r\n#4 Step-by-step guide\r\n#5 Insights from the visualisation\r\n#1 Asessment of visualisation based on clarity and aesthetics\r\n“With population ageing and sustained rise in LFPR of older residents, the share of residents aged 55 & over in the labour force rose substantially from 16% in 2009 to 25% in 2019. Meanwhile, the share of resident labour force aged 25 to 54 declined from 75% to 67% even as their LFPR increased, as the population cohorts moving into these age bands were smaller than those who moved out due to lower birth rates. As a result the median age of residents in the labour force rose from 41 years in 2009 to 44 years in 2019.”\r\nWithout the context of the primary communication intent of the above chart, it is difficult to provide an assessment of how it can be improved. As such,the critique below will be based solely on the rubrics of clarity and aesthetics.\r\n1.1 Clarity\r\n1.1.1 Annotations do not match the data presented in the table\r\n• The selected age bands grouped in the annotations are not shown in the visual data - it is hence difficult to match the description with the visual. (e.g. 16% in 2009 = 8+4.6+1.8+1.2 = 15.6) and (25% in 2019 = 2019 10.2+7.3+4.5+2.7=24.7).\r\n• The current data or visualisation does not show the LFPR increase for the resident labour force aged 25 to 54 described in the annotation.\r\n1.1.2 Which dataset is the visualisation referring to?\r\n• The annotations describe Labour Force Participation rate - however the data in the visualisation demonstrates data relating to resident labour force. This makes it difficult to follow the description.\r\n• As the data only shows proportion of the labour force, it is not possible to determine the total volume of the labor force - to see if it has grown or shrunk from 2009 to 2019.\r\n1.1.3 The main objective of the visualisation is not clear\r\n• If the main aim is to demonstrate a) aging labor force, and b) increase in LBFR for 55 and over, the current chart does not show the movement across the decade.\r\n• May be able to do bracketing to show the movement within the age groups.\r\n1.2 Aesthetics\r\n1.2.1 Labelling of Figure titles and captions\r\n• The chart adopts a 538 style of visuals, with the the chart’s Title and Subtitle nested in the top left corner of the visualisation. While it is a trendy style to imitate, it is not executed well here as it the caption ‘per cent’ describes neither the title nor the graphic.\r\n• Instead, the subtitle ‘per cent’ could be moved closer to the table, so as to more clearly indicate that the data in the table are percentages.\r\n• The caption could then be changed to indicate that the graphic is intended to present the key point in the annotation - which is the shift in labour force demographic from 2009 to 2019.\r\n• The median of the graphic uses a continuous representation whereas the x axis is based on a categorical variable. This conflation is technically inaccurate and may make it confusing for the reader.\r\n1.2.2 Not ideal for readers with Colour-Vision Deficiencies (CVD)\r\n• In terms of aesthetics, the colour choice of grey and blue may be difficult to distinguish, especially for those with colour-vision deficiency (deuteranomaly).\r\n• It would be more helpful to refer to CVD safe colour scales so as to reach out to a wider group of readers. CVD simulators can be found [online](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/.\r\n• However, there is a lot of restraint in the terms of the use of colours, and this helps keep clutter to a minimum. This is generally good practice as it allows the reader to easily discern the main points.\r\n1.2.3 Directing focus with highlights\r\n• There are two vertical reference lines to show the change in the median age from 41 years old to 44 years old. A visual cue could have been added to show the shift. This can be done in the form of a small arrow.\r\n• It also does not show the largest changes in each cohort (ie. 15-19 remained the same).\r\n• At the same time, within each cohort, changes could be made to show whether the cohort witnessed an increase or decrease.\r\n#2 Sketch of Alternate Design\r\nSource: Sketch of alternate designThe sketch above highlights the three key proposals for change from the original visualisation:\r\n• The first is to improve the layout of titles and labels on the axis. The intent to provide clear text labels while keeping the visualisation clutter-free by reducing duplication or irrelevant information.\r\n• Secondly, as the main objective is to demonstrate the key shifts from 2009 2019, a decision was made to select LFPR only.\r\n• Lastly, we intend to include a time series – since the data is provide by MOM – in order to identify if the shifts in LFPR can be attributed to key events during that decade.\r\n#3 Proposed Visualisation in Tableau\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Data Re-presented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe visualisation was built using Tableau Desktop Professional Edition 2020.40.\r\nThe key change made in the data visualisation is to include key events and its possible impact on LFPR. This means utilising a time series instead of just comparing two points of data, 2019 and 2009. Based timeline, it is likely policy changes have directly led to changes in LFPR.\r\nIn addition, a feature that was integrated into the LFPR dataset was the gender demographic as we wanted to examine if policy shifts had an impact on male and female workers in the population.\r\nLastly, visual changes were made to ensure consistency and clarity when comparing LBFR. A greyscale was also adopted for the demographic age groups, in order to suggest Singapore’s aging labour force.\r\n#4 Step-by-step guide\r\nThe following steps will provide a brief overview of how the visualisation was completed.\r\nData Preparation\r\nThe data used for the visualisations were taken from the Ministry of Manpower’s website - Resident Labour Force Participation Rate by Age and Sex 2009 - 2019 June.\r\nSteps\r\nData Preparation\r\nData in excel was imported via Tableau\r\n\r\nData was examined using Tableau’s data viewer. As only certain age groups was needed, these were selected and filtered out for export.\r\n\r\nData was then exported to Excel and manually adjusted. This is because we intended to use gender as an additional category. As such, data in the other sheets were merged together to form a combined worksheet.\r\n\r\nLastly, the adjusted Excel document was imported again in Tableau. The data fields was cleaned to ensure that the values were accurately represented\r\n\r\nCharting Visualisation\r\nNext, with the data prepared, Tableau’s Polaris was used to visualise the worksheet\r\nSteps\r\nCharting Visualisation\r\nAfter adding age group and year to columns and LFPR and it’s duplicate to rows, you should get a graph that looks like this\r\n\r\nRight click on the graph and select dual axis to combine both charts. Now syncrhonise and edit the axis\r\n\r\nAn important step is to ensure that the axis were fixed - as there are null values inserted to create a separate category (total & gender)\r\n\r\nAdd gender to the color filter to adjust the graph’s colour palette\r\n\r\nAdd annotations to highlight key events in the timeline\r\n\r\nWe added a reference line in order to add visual cues to the change in female worker (55 - 64)\r\n\r\nFinally, edit the caption below the X axis to credit source\r\n\r\n#5 Insights from the visualisation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Data Re-presented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.1 Aging Labour Force in Singapore\r\n• There is an observe shift in Singapore’s LFPR, with more elderly workers from the ages of 55 and above remaining active in the population’s labour force.\r\n• This shift is most observable in the age groups of 55 – 64 with an increase in 9.3 percentage points from 2009 and 65 and over with an increase in 11.5 percentage points in the same period.\r\n• This is likely to increase in the next decade, especially with proposed changes to retirement age (raise from 62 to 65 by 2030) and re-employment age (raise from 67 to 70 by 2030)\r\n5.2 Government Policy has an impact on LFPR\r\n• Government policy introduced in the last decade has allowed Singapore’s aging population provide more protections to older workers.\r\n• This is necessary to protect our aging workforce, by legislating that companies extend their retirement and re-employment age, to ensure that older workers in Singapore can continue to work and support themselves in old age.\r\n• As there was intense debate in 2013 regarding Singapore’s Population White Paper, it would be interesting to integrate foreign worker data to understand better how Government measures have protected Singaporean workers – whilst ensuring a viable labour force in Singapore.\r\n5.3 Dramatic shifts in gender demographic between 2009 and 2019\r\n• Based on the visualisation, the most dramatic changes from 2009 to 2019 is the increase in female workers in the LBFR across three different age groups from 25 years upwards.\r\n• This could be attributed to the trend of dual income families from the turn of the century. More recently, these changes could be attributed to changes to improve protections to female workers following the CEDAW report in 2011. Changes to protect working mothers was also introduced together with the Employment Act amendments in 2013.\r\n• Of note, is the largest increase in the older female demographic (as high as 15.6 percentage pts), likely due to protections made for older workers guaranteeing their employment past the ages of 62.\r\nThank you for reading up to this point!\r\nThis blog is a data visualisation assignment for the MITB programme at the Singapore Management University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Introduction\r\nData collected by the Department of Statistics Singapore in the past 10 years (2009-2019) highlight a potential problem in our current society. It is revealed that Singapore’s population has begun to age, due to declining birth rates since 2010 . This correlates to having an aging working population where the labour force consists of a higher proportion of workers in the 50 and over age band as evident in the figure below.\r\nFIGURE 1: RESIDENT LABOUR FORCE BY AGEIn the context of Singapore, our labour force comprises of people above the age of 15 years old who are working or seeking work (regardless of employment status or citizenship). Using the dataset, Figure 1 was visualised by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), Manpower Research and Statistics Department. The purpose of the document explores how a makeover on the exact same dataset would allow for an alternative graphical representation and the advantageousness of said work.\r\n2. Critque on Clarity and Aesthetics\r\nClarity\r\nAesthetics\r\nData presented does not match storytelling. (16% in 2009 and 25% in 2019 represents a summation of the percentages values for age bands of 55 and above)\r\nColour scheme is dull and is not impactful to the reader.\r\nNo y-axis presented; reader has to refer to table values to determine that the y-axis represents the percentage of labour force.\r\nHorizontal reference lines looks similar to a bar, this may mislead the reader to place emphasis on the age band 40-44.\r\nNo annotation for values in table. Reader is unable to tell if they represent absolute values or a percentage.\r\nNo ‘spikes’. A bar chart might be better to visually represent the ‘small’ changes in percentage values.\r\nAge bands mentioned are not visually shown.\r\n\r\nLabour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) increase not shown visually\r\n\r\nTitle depicts the graph as the proportion of labour force by age, thus it is unable to show change in LFPR as stated.\r\n\r\n2.1 Proposed Design\r\nFIGURE 2: PROPOSED VISUALISATION IN TABLEAU3. Preparation \r\nVisualisation for Figure 1 uses derived values from Table 7: Resident Labour Force Aged Fifteen Years And Over By Age And Sex, 2009 - 2019 (June). For the makeover, we are tasked to use Table 5:Resident Labour Force Participation Rate by Age and Sex 2009 - 2019 (June).\r\nSteps\r\nData Preparation\r\nData in excel was cleaned by removing unecessary data rows and formatting issues\r\n\r\nData was examined using Tableau’s data viewer after arranging data in proposed visualisation. This step is repeated twice for both files. Data view was exported to .csv format\r\n\r\nAfter checking both files, a new excel (final.xlsx) was created containing the pivoted versions of the Labour force and LFPR\r\n\r\nVisualisation Process in Tableau is listed in the following section\r\nSteps\r\nVisualisation\r\nData was imported into Tableau\r\n\r\nFor the first bar chart titled ‘Labour Force by Years 2009,2019’, Category,Age Band and Year were placed into Columns while sum(value) was placed into rows. Bars were coloured according to Year Values\r\n\r\nNext, to hide unnecessary data, Category and Age Band was placed into filters to display current visualisation\r\n\r\nTo highlight the change between the 2 years, a line chart was added, this was done by placing sum(value) in Row and creating a dual axis.Plot was coloured by sum(value), to make the line bar a single color, I edit the color values to be a 2-step color band and changed the minimum value to allow the bar to be colored dark red\r\n\r\nFinally, annotations were added to highlight derived insights.\r\n\r\nFor the dumb bell chart, similar steps was used as above, the main difference is that the circle option was selected for the visualisation.\r\n\r\n4. Observations from Makeover Visualisation \r\nFIGURE 3:FINAL DASHBOARD VISUALISATIONFrom the makeover done on the visualisation. We can derive clearer insights compared to the original graph.\r\nFrom the Labour Force by Years 2009,2019 Plot, there is a >22% increase in labour force aged 45&above when comparing 2019 with 2009. At a glance, this conveys to the audience the presence of an aging population in singapore.\r\nFrom the Labour Force Participation Rate by Years 2009,2019 Plot, the largest % increase in labour force participation rate was seen in the residents aged 65&over. This could be attirbuted to the increase of the retirement age from 65 to 67 in 2017 (Source: https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/retirement)\r\nBoth the 15-24 and 25-54 age bands show lesser increases in LFPR, this signifies that there could be low birth rates within the span of 10 years as the changes are not as significant compared to older workers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
